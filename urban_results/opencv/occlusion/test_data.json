At the initial position, you are asked to navigate according to a series of movement instructions. What is the Landmark Position of the intersection with the high-rise building when you reach your current location?  \nchoose:  \nA. I am located above the high-rise building bypass intersection.  \nB. I am far away from the high-rise building bypass intersection.  \nC. I am on the ground near the intersection of high-rise buildings.  \nD. I am located on the left side of the high-rise building bypass intersection.  \nE. I am under the intersection next to the tall building.",
